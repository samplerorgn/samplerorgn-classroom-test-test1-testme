# Predicting-Bank-Customer-Churn
## Objective:
You are tasked with building a predictive model to determine if a customer will leave the bank (churn). Using the Bank Customer Churn Dataset (available on Kaggle), you will load, clean, analyze, and create a machine learning model to predict customer churn.

### Task Breakdown:
### Task 1: Load the Dataset
#### Points: 5
Load the Bank Customer Churn Dataset into a Pandas DataFrame.
Check for missing values and understand the basic structure of the data.

### Task 2: Data Cleaning
#### Points: 5
Handle any missing values appropriately.
Ensure the dataset is clean, with no anomalies.

### Task 3: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
#### Points: 5
Generate summary statistics (mean, median, mode) for key variables.
Visualize the distribution of important variables such as age, balance, credit_score, and estimated_salary.

### Task 4: Feature Engineering
#### Points: 5
Create new features from the existing columns. For example:
Create age groups.
Categorize account balances.
Encode categorical features like country, gender, and credit_card.

### Task 5: Model Training
#### Points: 10
Train a machine learning classification model (such as Random Forest, Logistic Regression, or XGBoost) to predict whether a customer will churn.
Use the cleaned and feature-engineered data as input.

### Task 6: Model Evaluation
#### Points: 10
Evaluate the performance of your model using metrics like accuracy or F1 score.
